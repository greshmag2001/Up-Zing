api call(to connect backend to frontend)
--------

-library- axios
-npm i axios


async await
-----------
->without async await
asyncFunction=()=>{
    asyncCode().then(data=>{
        console.log(data)
    })
}

->with async await
asyncFunction=async()=>{
    const data=await asyncCode()
    console.log(data)
}

data sharing in sibling components
----------------------------------
state lifting
-------------
(state, function)
parent ---- child 1 ... function
       ---- child 2 ... state

       REACT FORM
       ----------

    -Controlled component : managed by react component, set states to its value field of user inputs
    -Uncontrolled components: managed by Real DOM
-Set up path for REACT component
    -can set up path in app/ Root component
    -install react-router-dom package: npm i react-router-dom
        -Entire react app should be render in BrowseRouter selector
        -place all component that need path in routes selector
        -set up path using route selector for each component

1. useEffect(callback,dependency): used to provide side effects to functional component
        -based on dependency we can provide side effects
            -if dependency is not provided, apply side effects all the time
            -if dependencyis empty array: apply side effect at the time of component creation.
            -if dependency is array with state/props: apply side effect at the time of component creation
             and as well as when valueof state/prop changes.

Data sharing b/w components
---------------------------
    -sharing only from parent to child- use props
     -props : property of component, its type isobject, to access props from component argument
    -share data b/w siblings - state lifting
